## Getting data from Google Finance

In this lecture we'll create a python code that can be used to download historical prices from [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance).

The task is a simple one, we just need to find the symbol of the stock and the exchange, and our program will create the appropiate URL ;).

**Note**

Seems that you can't download historical data for currencies, this method works only for equity instruments.

Now let's get started!

### Requirements

For you to follow this lecture please make sure that you have the following python package installed:

* pandas (I used version 0.18.0 for this lecture).

### Explaining the URL (The theory)

The URL that we'll need, looks something like this:

http://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q=BMV:AMXL&startdate=Jan+3+2000&enddate=Nov+11+2017&output=csv

At first, this might be daunting but the only parts you have to worry about are:

* **q=BMV:AMXL** this part makes reference to the exchange where our stock is listed (in this case Bolsa Mexicana de Valores - Mexican Stock Exchange) and the symbol for identifying the company (in this case America Movil Serie L)

* **startdate=Jan+3+2000**

* **enddate=Nov+11+2017** 

I think there is no need for me to explain you the last two parameters you're smart enough to figure out what they are ;).

The remaining parts of the URL are kept as they are, so basically our code only needs the above three parameters and no more. 

### And finally the code (The practice)

```{python, engine.path='/home/david/anaconda2/bin/python',eval=FALSE}
import pandas as pd

def getGooglePrices(exchanges,symbols,startDate,endDate):
    '''
    Gets historical data from Google Finance
    Parameters:
    
    exchanges = list of the exchanges according to the nomenclature
    used by Google Finance
    
    symbols = list of stock symbols according to the symbols from
    Google Finance (Same length) as exchanges
    
    The correspondance must have the form Ex1:Sym1, Ex2:Sym2,...etc
    
    startDate = Start date in format Mmm+dd+yyyy
    
    endDate = End date in format Mmm+dd+yyyy

    Output
    
    No output, the data is stored in the current working directory
    as CSV file.
    
    '''
    #Declare the static parts of the URL
    urlStatic1="http://finance.google.com/finance/historical?q="
    urlStatic2="&output=csv"

    #Create the dynamic parts of the url and downloads a file
    #per symbol
    
    for i in range(0,len(exchanges)):
        quote=exchanges[i] + ":" + symbols[i]
        url=urlStatic1 + quote + "&startdate=" + startDate\
        + "&enddate=" + endDate + urlStatic2
            
        #Read the data from the url
        data=pd.read_csv(url)
            
        #Save it in the current directory
        #Removes the column index
        fileName=exchanges[i] + "_" + symbols[i] + ".csv"
        data.to_csv(fileName,index=False)

```

### Testing the code

Now let's test our code with the following examples

```{python,engine.path='/home/david/anaconda2/bin/python',eval=FALSE}
exchanges=["BMV","BMV","NYSEARCA"]
symbols=["AMXL","KOFL","SPY"]
startDate="Jan+01+2017"
endDate="Nov+10+2017"
getGooglePrices(exchanges,symbols,startDate,endDate)
```

The above lines should have created 3 CSV files each containing the historical prices from January 3rd 2017 (01 and 02 were not working days) up to and including November 10th 2017.

Try with your own symbols.

### Conclusion

As you can see, the code has not error handlers so make sure that the symbols and exchanges you enter are the correct ones.

Also you can implement a little function so you can read these variables from a csv file avoiding you having to type them manually, but I won't take all the fun from you :)

Hope you find the above useful

Thanks for reading!
